# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v56.0.0/ before writing any code.

## Dual-React setup — do not run `npm dedupe`

This workspace intentionally ships two React versions side-by-side:

- **`apps/mobile`** — React 19.2.3 + react-native 0.85.3 (Expo SDK 56 requirement)
- **root / `apps/web`** — React 18.3.1

The root `package.json` carries an `overrides` block that pins `@beyou/mobile`'s `react`
and `react-native` to their required versions so npm never hoists them out of
`apps/mobile/node_modules`:

```json
"overrides": {
  "@beyou/mobile": {
    "react": "19.2.3",
    "react-native": "0.85.3"
  }
}
```

In `metro.config.js`, `nodeModulesPaths` lists `apps/mobile/node_modules` first, and
`resolver.extraNodeModules` explicitly pins `react` + `react-native` to the mobile copy —
so the bundler always resolves React 19 from `apps/mobile/node_modules`, not the root.

> **Do NOT set `disableHierarchicalLookup: true`.** It was tried and broke the bundle:
> Expo installs some transitive deps nested (e.g. `expo` → `expo-asset` under
> `apps/mobile/node_modules/expo/node_modules/`), and disabling hierarchical lookup makes
> Metro unable to resolve them. Hierarchical lookup must stay ENABLED; the `extraNodeModules`
> pin above is what guarantees the single React, not the lookup flag.

Running `npm dedupe` would collapse the two React installs into one and break the mobile
bundler at runtime. Do not run it. If you must tidy the lock file, run
`npm install --prefer-dedupe` and immediately verify with:

```bash
cat apps/mobile/node_modules/react/package.json | grep '"version"'   # must be 19.x
cat node_modules/react/package.json | grep '"version"'               # must be 18.x
```

## NativeWind v4 — metro config WRAPS, it does not replace

`metro.config.js` ends with `module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: './global.css' })`.
The monorepo `config` (watchFolders, `nodeModulesPaths`, `extraNodeModules` React pin) is built
first and PASSED INTO `withNativeWind`. Keep that order — if you regenerate metro config, re-apply
the wrap around the existing monorepo config, don't overwrite it. `babel.config.js` uses
`['babel-preset-expo', { jsxImportSource: 'nativewind' }]` + the `nativewind/babel` preset. Theme
colors are CSS variables set at runtime by `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` (`vars()` from nativewind);
never hardcode hex — use the Tailwind tokens (`bg-background`, `text-primary`, …) wired in
`tailwind.config.js`.

## Expo Router — test files must NOT live under `app/`

Expo Router builds its route table via `require.context('./app')`, which has no `.test.tsx`
exclusion. A test colocated in `app/` is (a) treated as a route and (b) pulled into the production
bundle — `npx expo export` then fails resolving test-only deps. **Put route tests in `__tests__/`**
(see `__tests__/_layout.test.tsx`, `login.test.tsx`, `register.test.tsx`). Always run
`npx expo export --platform android` as part of verification — `npm test` passing does NOT catch a
broken production bundle.

## Jest — act environment + async-thunk tests

`jest.setup.js` sets `globalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true` (wired via `setupFilesAfterEnv`).
For any test that dispatches an async redux thunk on a user event, wrap the interaction in
`await act(async () => { fireEvent...; })` so the thunk's trailing re-render settles inside that act
scope — otherwise it leaks into the next test and corrupts its render ("overlapping act() calls").
Use a fresh store per test (`makeStore()` from `src/store.ts`); Redux state is not reset between
Jest cases. `@expo/vector-icons` is mocked globally in `__mocks__/@expo/vector-icons.js` (the real
package pulls `expo-asset`, an Expo-nested transitive dep jest can't resolve).

Tests that import `expo-router` directly (`useRouter`, `Stack`, …) must `jest.mock('expo-router', …)`
— the real module is ESM that fails to parse under jest. Tests that mount `react-native-toast-message`
must stub it (its Animated loop leaves active timers); see `_layout.test.tsx`.

## Jest — react-native-reanimated mock (hand-rolled)

`react-native-reanimated` v4 throws at import under jest — *"Native part of Worklets doesn't seem to
be initialized"* — because `react-native-worklets`' native module isn't present. Its bundled
`react-native-reanimated/mock` does NOT help: it re-imports the real index, re-triggering worklets
init. So `jest.setup.js` registers a **self-contained** `jest.mock('react-native-reanimated', …)` that
requires nothing real — passthrough `Animated.View`/`Text`, `useSharedValue`/`useAnimatedStyle`/
`withTiming`/`withSpring`/`useReducedMotion` no-ops, an `Easing` Proxy, and chainable entering presets
(`FadeInDown`…). NativeWind only uses reanimated lazily for static `className` styling, so this does
not affect the other tests. `npx expo export` uses the REAL reanimated, so always run it to validate
the production bundle. The reanimated babel plugin must stay LAST in `babel.config.js`.

## Dashboard (Phase 3)

The dashboard reuses the shared `@beyou/*` data layer end-to-end: slices wired in `src/store.ts`,
loaded by `src/dashboard/useDashboardData.ts`, check-in via `src/dashboard/useRoutineCheckin.ts` →
`@beyou/state` `applyRefreshUi` (the gamification brain, shared with web). UI lives in
`src/ui/dashboard/` (ProfileHeader, RoutineDay/RoutineItem, Shortcuts, XpFloat, CelebrationOverlay,
RoutineCompleteSummary, ProgressRing). Section screens (categories/habits/…) are `ComingSoon` stubs;
logout lives on the configuration stub.

## Icons (Phase 4 — shared `@beyou/icons` + Lucide)

Icons resolve through the platform-neutral `@beyou/icons` package: `resolveIcon(id)` →
`{ lucide:name | emoji:char | fallback }` (ids: `lucide:<kebab>`, `emoji:<short_name>`, raw emoji
char; legacy react-icons `ri:*` → fallback). Render saved icons with `src/ui/BeyouIcon.tsx`:
emoji → `<Text>` char; lucide → `lucide-react-native` PascalCase component (kebab→Pascal via
`import * as`); fallback → nothing (unless `showFallback`). `lucide-react-native` is mocked in
`jest.setup.js` (a Proxy of no-op components) — it ships ~1754 icon modules; don't transform it in
jest, and `expo export` validates it bundles for real. Web uses `lucide-react`'s `DynamicIcon`
(code-split); the registry/search/picker live in `@beyou/icons` (data) + each app's `BeyouIcon`
(render). Data is generated: `packages/icons/scripts/generate-data.mjs` (lucide names + slim emoji
char map).

## Configuration + widgets (Phase 5)

Settings live at `app/(app)/configuration.tsx` as `ConfigSection`s (`src/ui/config/`): Profile
(rhf + shared `profileSchema`, photo via URL modal), Appearance (`ThemeSelector` + persist),
Preferences (Language/`RoutineSettings`/`Constance`), and Dashboard (`WidgetsSection` picker). Every
control persists via `editUser` (`@beyou/api/user/editUser`) + a `perfilSlice` action + `notify`;
`constanceConfiguration` is editUser-only (no slice field). Saved theme/language apply on boot via
`src/theme/ThemeSync.tsx` / `src/i18n/LanguageSync.tsx` (in `_layout`, keyed on the saved value so a
live pick isn't overridden). NativeWind `mt-*` didn't reliably apply to the config section divider —
use an inline `style` margin there.

Dashboard widgets (`src/ui/widgets/`): `WIDGET_IDS`/`BIG_WIDGETS` come from `@beyou/state`.
`DashboardWidgets` renders `perfil.widgetsIdsInUse` (full-width stack; empty → CTA to config). The 7
widgets mirror web; charts are hand-drawn with `react-native-svg` (`CategoryBalanceWidget` radar,
`DailyProgressWidget` reuses `ProgressRing`) — NOT chart.js. The picker (`config/WidgetsSection`) is
add/remove + ↑↓ reorder (no drag-drop) → `editUser({widgetsId})`.

## Icon picker + Habits (Phase 6)

Icon picker (`src/ui/icons/`): `IconPicker` is a bottom-sheet `Modal` mirroring the web `iconsBox`
(search + All/Recents/Icons/Emoji tabs + a `FlatList` grid of `BeyouIcon` tiles); it `searchIcons`
from `@beyou/icons` and emits the canonical id (`normalizeIconId`) on select. It **early-returns null
when `!visible`** — RN `Modal` renders children regardless of `visible` under jest, so the gate keeps
closed-picker tests deterministic and skips mounting the grid. `IconPickerField` is the labeled form
field. Recents use `iconRecents.ts` = an **in-memory sync** adapter for `createIconRecents` (the shared
storage interface is sync; AsyncStorage is async → recents are session-scoped for v1).

Habits (`app/(app)/habits.tsx` + `src/ui/habits/`): real CRUD on the shared `@beyou/api/habits` +
`@beyou/state/habit` + `@beyou/validation` habit schemas. The screen self-fetches habits + categories
(direct nav needs it; the dashboard also loads them) and refetches after every mutation via an
`onSaved` callback. `HabitForm` is a full-screen modal (rhf + `habitCreate/EditSchema`); the schema
field is `difficulty` (correct) but the wire field is `dificulty` (keep the typo) — the api fns take
positional args so just pass the value. Importance/Difficulty are 1–5 segments; experience (create
only) maps 0/1/2 → BEGINNER/INTERMEDIARY/ADVANCED via the api's `experienceToEnum`. Delete confirms
with the **native `Alert.alert`** (no custom modal). Create/edit return `{success?|error?|validation?}`
→ `getFriendlyErrorMessage` + `notify`. Inline category-create is deferred (pick existing only).

**Jest act note (reinforced):** ANY `fireEvent` that toggles component/provider state must be wrapped
in `await act(async () => …)` — even on a *controlled* component (the `BeyouThemeProvider` settle
leaks otherwise), or the unwrapped update corrupts the NEXT test in the file ("overlapping act()").

## Routines (Phase 7)

Routines CRUD lives across two screens and a builder modal:

- **`app/(app)/routines.tsx`** — list screen; self-fetches routines + habits + tasks into the store; the `+` create button (testID `create-routine`) opens `RoutineBuilder mode="create"`; `onSaved={load}` refetches everything.
- **`app/(app)/routines/[id].tsx`** — detail screen; reads routine from the slice by id; the edit button (`create-outline` icon, testID `edit-routine`) opens `RoutineBuilder mode="edit" routine={routine}`; `onSaved` re-calls `getRoutines` → `enterRoutines`. Delete uses `Alert.alert` + `deleteRoutine`.
- **`src/ui/routines/RoutineBuilder.tsx`** — full-page `Modal` slide; manages a working-copy of the routine (deep-cloned from prop on open); `routineFormSchema` validates name+sections before submit; calls `createRoutine`/`editRoutine`; `onSaved()` is called after success, `onClose()` dismisses.
- **`src/ui/routines/SectionSheet.tsx`** — bottom sheet for add/edit a section (name + time via `TimeField`).
- **`src/ui/routines/ItemPickerSheet.tsx`** — bottom sheet to assign habits + tasks to a section.
- **`src/ui/routines/SectionCard.tsx`** — row card for a section inside the builder (edit / assign / move / remove).
- **`src/ui/routines/TimeField.tsx`** — native `DateTimePicker` in time mode; exports `toHHmm`/`hhmmToDate`.

## Routines schedule/snapshot/AI (Phase 7 Group C)

**Schedule** — `src/ui/routines/ScheduleSheet.tsx` is a bottom sheet opened from the detail screen
(`app/(app)/routines/[id].tsx`) via a `Pressable` (testID `schedule-routine`). It renders
day-of-week checkboxes (`DAYS` exported from `src/ui/routines/ScheduleIndicator.tsx`) and calls
`createSchedule(days, routineId, t)` (default export of `@beyou/api/schedule/createSchedule`) or
`editSchedule(scheduleId, days, routineId, t)` (default export of `@beyou/api/schedule/editSchedule`).
The save button carries testID `schedule-save`. On success it refetches schedules and notifies.
A conflict hint is computed **client-side**: the detail screen fetches all schedules via `getSchedules`
and passes the other-routine list as `otherSchedules` to `ScheduleSheet`, which derives a `blockedBy`
map (day → routine name) locally — there is no `SCHEDULE_CONFLICT` backend error key.

**Snapshot history** — `src/ui/routines/SnapshotHistory.tsx` sits below the builder in the detail
screen and lets the user browse past day snapshots for that routine. Chips for the last 7 days (plus
a calendar picker) drive `getSnapshot` / `getSnapshotDatesForMonth` calls (named exports of
`@beyou/api/routine/snapshot`) that populate `snapshotSlice` (`enterSnapshot`, `enterSnapshotDates`,
`setSelectedDate`; the reducer is wired in `apps/mobile/src/store.ts` as `snapshot`). The selected
snapshot is rendered by `src/ui/routines/SnapshotCard.tsx` which calls `useSnapshotCheckin` for
check/skip actions. `useSnapshotCheckin` calls `checkSnapshotItem(snapshotId, snapshotCheckId, t)` /
`skipSnapshotItem(snapshotId, snapshotCheckId, t)` (named exports of `@beyou/api/routine/snapshot`),
then pipes the `RefreshUiDTO` response through `applyRefreshUi` (the shared gamification brain from
`@beyou/state`) and dispatches a fresh `getSnapshot` to re-sync display state.

**AI wizard** — `src/ui/routines/AiRoutineSheet.tsx` is a bottom-sheet `Modal` with a single text
input (testID `ai-description`). On submit it calls `generateRoutine` (draft → server AI), then
`materializeRoutine` (draft → creates real habits/tasks/categories in the backend). The returned
`MaterializeResponseDTO` is mapped to `RoutineSection[]` via `materializeToSections` from
`@beyou/api/ai/draftMapping`, and then passed to `onReady(name, sections)`. The list screen
(`app/(app)/routines.tsx`) wires it as follows: the AI button (testID `ai-routine`,
`sparkles-outline` icon) opens `AiRoutineSheet`; `onReady` closes the sheet and sets `aiSeed`
state (`{ name, iconId: '', routineSections }`); a dedicated seeded `RoutineBuilder mode="create"`
renders when `aiSeed !== null`, pre-populated via its `routine` prop. **Orphan-on-cancel quirk
(web parity):** `materializeRoutine` creates entities in the backend *before* the user saves the
builder. If the user cancels the seeded builder, those habits/tasks/categories are left orphaned —
this matches the web app's behaviour and is a known product decision, not a bug. The e2e profile
swaps in a `CannedRoutineDraftGenerator` (deterministic, no real API key needed).
